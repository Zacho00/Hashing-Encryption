# Hashing-Encryption
For this weeks assignment, I have included two files.
sha.py & caesar.py

sha.py is a very simple example of hashing a message with sha256.

caesar.py prompts the user for a message, then uses a random number to encrypt the users message, with results similar to a caesar cypher.
